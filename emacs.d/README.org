* belak's emacs config

This config has been cobbled together from quite a few places.

Most notably, [[https://smf.io/dotfiles][smf's dotfiles]], [[https://github.com/dakrone/dakrone-dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/settings.org][dakrone's dotfiles]], [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]], and various other
sources.

** Setup

Just in case I mess something up, we enable debugging. It gets turned
off in [[Finalization]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq debug-on-error t)
  (setq debug-on-quit t)
#+end_src

The first thing we need to do is bootstrap the package system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
  (setq package-archives
        '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("marmalade" . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
          ("melpa"     . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
          ("elpy"      . "http://jorgenschaefer.github.io/packages/")))

  ;; Make sure we load everything
  (package-initialize)
  (when (not package-archive-contents)
    (package-refresh-contents))

  ;; Small macro to install a missing package
  (defun package-ensure-installed (package)
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (package-install package)))
#+end_src

Next we need to load [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and =req-package= so we can organize
everything a little bit better. =use-package= also includes some
useful tools for lazy-loading things when we need them to speed up the
startup time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-ensure-installed 'use-package)
  (package-ensure-installed 'req-package)

  (eval-when-compile
    (defvar use-package-verbose t)
    (require 'use-package))

  (require 'req-package)

  (require 'diminish)
  (require 'bind-key)

  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

** Utilities

Paradox is a replacement for =package-list-packages= offering a few
extra features. Note that we only load it on those commands because
it's something that only really matters when we manually start it up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package paradox
    :commands
    paradox-list-packages
    paradox-enable
    :config
    (setq paradox-automatically-star t)
    (setq paradox-execute-asynchronously t))
#+end_src

Magit is an amazing git wrapper which lets us do a whole ton of
different things.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package magit
    :bind
    ("M-g M-g" . magit-status)
    :commands
    magit-status)

  (req-package magit-filenotify
    :require magit
    :if (not (eq system-type 'darwin))
    :config
    (add-hook 'magit-status-mode-hook 'magit-filenotify-mode))
#+end_src

Make sure undo-tree is enabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package undo-tree
    :diminish undo-tree-mode
    :config
    (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
#+end_src

Load up zx2c4's [[http://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] utility so we can grab data out of it later.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package password-store
    :commands password-store-get)
#+end_src

=guide-key= provides a nice interface for showing prefix commands.

The currently defined prefixes are listed below.

|--------+-----------------------------------------|
| Prefix | Description                             |
|--------+-----------------------------------------|
| C-c    | Generic prefix for quite a few commands |
| C-x x  | Switching of different window modes     |
|--------+-----------------------------------------|

Note that because we don't need this right away, we wait for a few
seconds of idle time to load this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package guide-key
    :disabled t
    :diminish guide-key-mode
    :defer 5
    :config
    (guide-key-mode 1)
    (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("C-c" "C-x x")
          guide-key/idle-delay 0.5
          guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag t))
#+end_src

=which-key= is a fancier replacement for guide-key. It also makes it
very easy to fix the missing prefix commands, which was something that
really bugged me about guide-key.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package which-key
    :diminish which-key-mode
    :config
    (which-key-mode 1)
    (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5
          which-key-popup-type 'side-window
          which-key-side-window-location 'right))
#+end_src

** Appearance

Settings such as a default font, color scheme and modeline changes.
Note that the font should be overridden later, such as in platform
specific settings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package zenburn-theme
    :config
    (load-theme 'zenburn t))

  (defvar my/default-frame-font "Monospace 12")

  ;;(setq-default indicate-buffer-boundaries 'left)
  (setq column-number-mode t
        line-number-mode t
        ;;tooltip-use-echo-area t
        tooltip-delay 0
        tooltip-short-delay 0)

  (blink-cursor-mode 0)
#+end_src

=diminish-major-mode= is based off of a snippet from [[https://github.com/sandhu/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/teppoudo-diminish.el][Achint Sandhu's dotfiles]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defmacro diminish-major-mode (mode new-name)
    `(add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name ,mode) "-hook"))
               '(lambda () (setq mode-name ,new-name))))

  ;; Make the lisp modes a bit shorter
  (diminish-major-mode 'lisp-interaction-mode "λ»")
  (diminish-major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode "Eλ")
  (diminish-major-mode 'lisp-mode "λ")
#+end_src

=smart-mode-line= is a much cleaner modeline with a few extra features.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package smart-mode-line
    :config
    (setq sml/no-confirm-load-theme t
          sml/theme 'respectful)
    (sml/setup))
#+end_src

Make sure the git gutter is loaded. Note that the fringe doesn't work
in console mode, so we fall back to using the margin.

Note that this is actually called in the [[Finalization]] section

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package diff-hl)
  (defun make-frame-diff-hl ()
    (global-diff-hl-mode 0)
    (diff-hl-margin-mode 0)
    (if (display-graphic-p)
        (global-diff-hl-mode 1)
      (diff-hl-margin-mode 1)))
#+end_src

** Basic setup

Set up some smarter defaults, and make sure that some useful
environment vars (like HOME and GOPATH) are copied into the emacs env.

This section was originally based off of [[https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults/blob/d62a5813fa60d4c9425a795d85f956f0b8a663f8/better-defaults.el][better defaults]] but it has
since grown to be a bit more than that.

First we clean up the interface a bit, removing menus, toolbars and the scrollbar.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

Because I often make silly window mistakes, we enable winner-mode so
we can undo them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (winner-mode 1)
#+end_src

=ace-window= is a simpler way to jump around windows.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package ace-window
    :bind ("M-p" . ace-window))
#+end_src


Because I want zap-to-char to not nuke the character we're zapping to,
we simply replace it with zap-up-to-char.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (autoload 'zap-up-to-char "misc")

  (global-set-key [remap zap-to-char] 'zap-up-to-char)
#+end_src

Make sure we actually use the clipboard we want because X is annoying
and has something along the lines of 3 clipboard buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq x-select-enable-clipboard t
        x-select-enable-primary t
        x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING)
        save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t)
#+end_src

Disable startup screen and just display the scratch buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-buffer-choice t
        inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+end_src

Make sure that things like backups make it into their own directory
and not the current one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar save-place-file)
  (setq save-place-file (concat user-emacs-directory "places")
        backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(concat user-emacs-directory
                                                 "backups"))))
#+end_src

Change search functions to use regexp searches by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'isearch-forward-regexp)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-r") 'isearch-backward-regexp)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-%") 'query-replace-regexp)
#+end_src

Anzu will show how many seach results we got.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package anzu
    :diminish anzu-mode
    :config
    (global-anzu-mode +1))
#+end_src

General annoyances.

- Make sure the buffer name shows up with a directory if there are multiple with the same name
- Save the place in the file
- Show parens
- Show parens as quickly as possible
- Don't indent with tabs
- Ask y or n, not yes or no
- When matching parens, highlight the region
- Make extra functions show up when searching
- Change yanking locations
- Turn off the damn bell
- Require a final newline on files
- Follow symlinks when we need to
- Make sure to load newest versions of files, even if there are older compiled versions
- Ensure tabs show up as 4 spaces
- Hide pointer when we start typing
- Ensure we get unified diffs
- Enable focus follows mouse

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'uniquify)
  (setq uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward)

  (require 'saveplace)
  (setq-default save-place t)

  (show-paren-mode 1)

  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

  (setq show-paren-style 'expression
        show-paren-delay 0
        apropos-do-all t
        mouse-yank-at-point t
        ring-bell-function 'ignore
        lazy-highlight-initial-delay 0
        require-final-newline t
        vc-follow-symlinks t
        load-prefer-newer t
        tab-width 4
        make-pointer-invisible t
        diff-switches "-u"
        mouse-autoselect-window t)
#+end_src

Make mouse scrolling and scrolling in general a bit saner (in theory)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))
        mouse-wheel-follow-mouse t
        scroll-step 1)
#+end_src

Load some useful variables from the shell. By default, it grabs HOME,
but we grab GOPATH as well for go.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package exec-path-from-shell
    :config
    (add-to-list 'exec-path-from-shell-variables "GOPATH")
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

** Platform specifics

Font overrides as well as a few mac specific key binds to make emacs
easier to use. Additionally, in OSX we want to toggle fullscreen
because we want to be in full screen more often than not.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar x-gtk-use-system-tooltips)
  (defvar ns-use-native-fullscreen)
  (defvar mac-command-modifier)
  (defvar mac-option-modifier)
  (defvar mac-control-modifier)

  (cond ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
         (setq x-gtk-use-system-tooltips nil
               my/default-frame-font "Terminus 8"))

        ((eq system-type 'darwin)
         (setq ns-use-native-fullscreen t
               mac-command-modifier 'meta
               mac-option-modifier 'super
               mac-control-modifier 'control
               insert-directory-program "/usr/local/bin/gls")


         (toggle-frame-fullscreen)))
#+end_src

** Navigation

Smooth scroll makes sure there's a buffer between the top of the
window and the cursor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package smooth-scrolling
    :config
    (setq smooth-scroll-margin 5
          scroll-conservatively 101
          scroll-preserve-screen-position t
          auto-window-vscroll nil
          scroll-margin 5))
#+end_src

Make sure to use ido everywhere. Because we're currently using helm,
this is disabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package smex
    :disabled t
    :bind
    ("M-x" . smex)
    ("M-X" . smex-major-mode-commands))

  (req-package ido
    :disabled t
    :config
    (ido-mode 1)
    (ido-everywhere 1)
    (setq resize-mini-windows t
          ido-use-virtual-buffers t
          ido-enable-flex-matching t
          ido-vertical-show-count t))

  (req-package ido-ubiquitous
    :disabled t
    :config
    (ido-ubiquitous-mode 1))

  (req-package ido-vertical-mode
    :disabled t
    :config
    (ido-vertical-mode 1)
    (setq ido-vertical-define-keys 'C-n-C-p-up-and-down))

  (req-package flx-ido
    :disabled t
    :config
    (flx-ido-mode 1)
    (setq ido-use-faces nil))
#+end_src

Make sure we store recent files. This lets helm do fancy things.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'recentf)
  (recentf-mode 1)
#+end_src

Helm is a much fancier replacement for ido. There are a few settings
we override (such as reversing C-z and tab, but for the most part the
defaults are fine.

=helm-mini= is used in place of any buffer related helm functions as
we can make it use recentf.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package helm
    :diminish helm-mode
    :bind
    ("M-x"     . helm-M-x)
    ("C-x b"   . helm-mini)
    ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files)
    ("C-c o"   . helm-occur)
    ("M-/"     . helm-dabbrev)
    :config
    ;; Reverse tab and C-z
    (bind-keys :map helm-map
               ("<tab>" . helm-execute-persistent-action)
               ("C-z"   . helm-select-action))

    (bind-keys :map org-mode-map
               ("C-c h" . helm-org-in-buffer-headings))

    (helm-mode 1)

    ;; Resize based on the number of results
    (helm-autoresize-mode 1)

    ;; Turn on fuzzy matching for everything we can
    (custom-set-variables '(helm-recentf-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-completion-in-region-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-buffers-fuzzy-matching t)
                          '(helm-locate-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-M-x-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-semantic-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-imenu-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-apropos-fuzzy-match t)
                          '(helm-lisp-fuzzy-completion t)
                          '(helm-ff-file-name-history-use-recentf t)))

  (req-package helm-ag
    :commands
    helm-ag
    helm-ag-project-root
    :require helm)

  (req-package helm-swoop
    ;;:bind ("C-s" . helm-swoop)
    :config
    (setq helm-swoop-speed-or-color t))
#+end_src

Perspective creates different views to switch between. This needs to
be loaded on startup so the modeline is set up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package perspective
    :config
    (persp-mode))
#+end_src

Project based navigation. I would be completely lost without this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config
    (projectile-global-mode))

  (req-package helm-projectile
    :require (helm projectile)
    :config
    (helm-projectile-on))
#+end_src

** Dired

Make a few improvements to dired.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package dired+)
#+end_src

Do our best to make sure that we don't litter the buffer list with
dired buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package dired-single
    :requires (dired+)
    :config
    (defun belak/dired-up ()
      (interactive)
      (dired-single-buffer ".."))

    (defun belak/dired-select ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((prev-buffer (current-buffer)))
        (dired-single-buffer)
        (if (eq 'dired-mode (with-current-buffer prev-buffer major-mode))
            (kill-buffer prev-buffer))))

    (bind-keys :map dired-mode-map
               ("<return>"  . belak/dired-select)
               ("^"         . belak/dired-up)
               ("q"         . kill-this-buffer)))
#+end_src

Make dired navigation much prettier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package stripe-buffer
    :config
    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'stripe-listify-buffer))
#+end_src

** Programming

Anything programming related goes in here. There are sections for
completion, general config and separate sections for each language.

*** General

Set a few things for prog-mode based major modes, such as line numbers
and trailing whitespace.

Note that because =electric-pair-mode= is a global mode we don't
bother putting it into the prog mode hook.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (electric-pair-mode 1)

  (defun my-prog-mode-hook ()
    "Some simple programming settings"
    (interactive)
    (linum-mode 1)
    (setq show-trailing-whitespace t))

  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'my-prog-mode-hook)

  (require 'eldoc)
  (diminish 'eldoc-mode)

  (global-prettify-symbols-mode +1)
#+end_src

=fic-mode= makes sure I actually notice comments with TODO, FIXME and
XXX.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package fic-mode
    :diminish fic-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'turn-on-fic-mode))
#+end_src

=rainbow-delimiters= is for more than just parentheses. It works for
brackets as well. This mode makes it easier to see nested delimiters.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package rainbow-delimiters
    :config
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+end_src

Disable most of the vc backends.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git Hg))
#+end_src

With vc related stuffs, it's nice to revert buffers automatically if
they've changed on disk.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
  (setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
#+end_src

*** Completion

There are two main completion packages. =auto-complete= is older and a
bit rougher around the edges. =company= is newer and not everything
works with it yet, but at least for me it has a tendency to be more
stable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package company
    :diminish company-mode
    :config
    (setq company-idle-delay 0)
    (global-company-mode))
#+end_src

*** Snippets

Not much to say here. We turn snippets on everywhere.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package yasnippet
    :config
    (setq yas-verbosity 0)
    (yas-global-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** Syntax

Turn on syntax checking using flycheck. Because it has so many built
in, in most instances we won't even need to install a plugin.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package flycheck
    :requires (which-key)
    :config
    (global-flycheck-mode)
    (which-key-add-key-based-replacements "C-c !" "Flycheck"))
#+end_src

*** Lisp

Rainbow blocks highlights blocks instead of keywords.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package rainbow-blocks
    :disabled t
    :config
    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'rainbow-blocks-mode)
    (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'rainbow-blocks-mode))
#+end_src

Make common symbols prettier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (push '("lambda" . ?λ) prettify-symbols-alist)))
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (push '("fn" . ?ƒ) prettify-symbols-alist)))
#+end_src

*** C/C++

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package irony
    :diminish irony-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
    (add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)

    ;; replace the `completion-at-point' and `complete-symbol' bindings
    ;; in irony-mode's buffers by irony-mode's function and run the
    ;; autosetup function
    (defun my-irony-mode-hook ()
      (define-key irony-mode-map [remap completion-at-point]
        'irony-completion-at-point-async)
      (define-key irony-mode-map [remap complete-symbol]
        'irony-completion-at-point-async)
      (irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options))

    (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'my-irony-mode-hook))

  (req-package company-irony
    :require (irony company)
    :config
    (defun my-company-irony-mode-hook ()
      (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends) '(company-irony))
      (company-irony-setup-begin-commands))
    (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'my-company-irony-mode-hook))

  (req-package flycheck-irony
    :require (irony flycheck)
    :config
    (eval-after-load 'flycheck
      '(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-irony-setup)))
#+end_src

*** Go

This enables most of the fairly standard things available in other go
setups. Simple completion and gofmt are the most important of those
features, at least to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package go-mode

    (add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'go-oracle-mode)

    (add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'my-company-go-mode-hook))
#+end_src

*** Python

Anaconda mode does navigation, docs and auto-completion. Because
that's pretty much all I need, I use this in place of elpy.

We set python-mode to load on .py files as a hack to get anaconda-mode
to load in the background.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package anaconda-mode
    :diminish anaconda-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'anaconda-mode)
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode))

  (req-package company-anaconda
    :requires (anaconda-mode company)
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-anaconda))
#+end_src

This is a reimplementation of virtualenvwrapper in emacs. We need to
load it right away to make sure the modeline is updated.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package virtualenvwrapper
    :config
    (setq virtualenv-location (expand-file-name "~/.virtualenvs/"))

    (defvar my-venv-current-name)
    (put 'my-venv-current-name 'risky-local-variable t)

    (defun my-update-venv-modestring ()
      (setq my-venv-current-name
            (list "["
                  (propertize
                   (if venv-current-name venv-current-name "")
                   'face 'persp-selected-face)
                  "]"))

      (setq global-mode-string (or global-mode-string '("")))
      (setq global-mode-string (delq 'my-venv-current-name global-mode-string))
      (setq global-mode-string (append global-mode-string '(my-venv-current-name))))

    (add-hook 'venv-postactivate-hook 'my-update-venv-modestring)
    (add-hook 'venv-predeactivate-hook 'my-update-venv-modestring)

    (my-update-venv-modestring))
#+end_src

*** Web Dev

These are any packages useful for web dev.

Most of this section is just supporting additional formats, however
=rainbow-mode= is here so we can preview the actual colors in css.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package rainbow-mode
    :commands rainbow-mode)

  (req-package web-mode
    :mode
    "\\.jinja$"
    "\\.html$"
    :config
    (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 2
          web-mode-css-indent-offset 2
          web-mode-code-indent-offset 2))

  (req-package less-css-mode
    :mode "\\.less$")
#+end_src

There's quite a bit of js stuff. We update the js2-error faces to
match flycheck and make sure tern is enabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package js2-mode
    ;; We only need flycheck for the faces we need to inherit from
    :require flycheck
    :mode
    "\\.js$"
    :config
    (setq js2-basic-offset 2)
    (set-face-attribute 'js2-error nil
                        :inherit 'flycheck-error-list-error
                        :underline '(:color foreground-color :style wave))
    (set-face-attribute 'js2-warning nil
                        :inherit 'flycheck-error-list-warning
                        :underline '(:color foreground-color :style wave)))

  (req-package tern
    :config
    ;; We don't need to depend on js2-mode because this will work
    ;; without it if it doesn't load for whatever reason.
    (add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda () (tern-mode t))))

  (req-package company-tern
    :require (company tern)
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-tern)
    (setq company-tern-property-marker ""))
#+end_src

*** Markup

Most markup modes are derived from text-mode, so we can turn on
auto-fill for all of them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
  (diminish 'auto-fill-function)
#+end_src

Make markdown-mode use gfm-markdown because it has most of the
extensions I care about.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package markdown-mode
    :mode ("\\.md$" . gfm-mode))
#+end_src

*** Misc

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package cmake-mode
    :mode
    "CMakeLists.txt"
    "\\.cmake$")

  (req-package lua-mode
    :mode "\\.lua$")

  (req-package yaml-mode
    :mode "\\.yml$")
#+end_src

** Org Mode

Make sure org mode is set up in a manner that doesn't suck. Meaning,
make code blocks act more like their native counterparts, enable fancy
indenting and allow for shift select.

If the extra require looks hacky, that's because it is. The =:demand=
makes sure the config runs because the package is already loaded to
run this config file. The =:diminish= keyword fails because
org-indent-mode does not exist by the time diminish is called.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package org
    :demand
    :mode ("\\.org$" . org-mode)
    :diminish org-indent-mode
    :init
    (require 'org-indent)
    (setq org-src-fontify-natively t
          org-src-tab-acts-natively t
          org-log-done t
          org-log-done-with-time t
          org-log-refile t
          org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes t
          org-refile-use-outline-path t
          org-support-shift-select t
          org-tag-alist '(("WORK" . ?w)
                          ("HOME" . ?h))
          org-agenda-files '("~/org/work.org"
                             "~/org/home.org")))
#+end_src

** IRC

This sets up the connection to my IRC bouncer. There are a few
additional packages that would be useful here, such as znc, but I
still prefer to keep my IRC in weechat, so this remains disabled for
now.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (req-package erc
      :disabled t
      :config
      (setq erc-prompt ">"
            znc-servers `(
                          ("znc.coded.io" "6697" t
                           ((
                             freenode
                             belak/freenode
                             ,(password-store-get "irc/freenode.net")))))))
#+end_src

** Email

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
  (req-package mu4e
    :ensure f
    :commands
    mu4e
    :config
    (setq mu4e-maildir "~/.mail/coded.io"
          mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -a"
          mu4e-html2text-command "elinks -dump"
          mu4e-use-fancy-chars t
          mu4e-confirm-quit nil
          mu4e-maildir-shortcuts '(("/inbox"   . ?i)
                                   ("/drafts"  . ?d)
                                   ("/sent"    . ?s)
                                   ("/archive" . ?a)
                                   ("/spam"    . ?z)
                                   ("/trash"   . ?t)))

    (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
          message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
          smtpmail-stream-type 'starttls
          smtpmail-smtp-service 25)

    (defvar belak/mu4e-send-map '()
      "Simple mapping of the 'To' header to the outgoing address.")
    (defvar belak/mu4e-default-email ""
      "Email to use when the send-map does not contain a matching address.")

    (defun belak/mu4e-compose-hook ()
      (setq user-mail-address
            (labels ((f (l)
                        (cond ((not msg) belak/mu4e-default-email)
                              ((not l) belak/mu4e-default-email)
                              ((mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg :to (car (car l)))
                               (cdr (car l)))
                              (t (f (car l))))))
              (f belak/mu4e-send-map)))

    (add-hook 'mu4e-compose-pre-hook 'belak/mu4e-compose-hook)))
#+end_src

** Scratch

This enables persistent scratch buffers. This allows for saving
scratch buffers along with the mode because I prefer to use org-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package persistent-scratch
    :config
    (persistent-scratch-setup-default)
    (persistent-scratch-autosave-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Custom

We still want to be able to have non-public configs, such as for
passwords and what not, so we put them in a separate file and load it,
but ignore errors, for instance if it doesn't exist.

This also makes it so customizations will go to this file and not to
the init.el, which we have version controlled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load custom-file t)
#+end_src

** Finalization

Actually load all the packages

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (req-package-finish)
#+end_src

Make sure everything is set up correctly depending on if we're daemonized or not.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-make-frame-functions (&optional frame)
    (if frame
      (select-frame frame))
    (make-frame-diff-hl)
    (set-frame-font my/default-frame-font))

  (if (daemonp)
      (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'my-make-frame-functions)
    (my-make-frame-functions))
#+end_src

Now that we're done, we can turn off error handling.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq debug-on-error nil)
  (setq debug-on-quit nil)
#+end_src

** Tasks

There was nothing to be done for this - tab already works. However,
tab inside code blocks does not currently work. I'm letting this go
for now.
*** DONE Make org-mode work well with windmove
CLOSED: [2015-06-22 Mon 01:35]
Looks like this was done a while back. Guess it's done now.
*** DONE Figure out why show-trailing-whitespace doesn't work
CLOSED: [2015-06-23 Tue 10:45]
Because it becomes buffer-local when set, we have to use setq-default,
not setq.
